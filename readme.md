# BScript Combat Log Script
## Hello Masters of the Dusty Paths

Here is a system developed precisely for this purpose: Advanced Game Exit Tracking Script â€“ completely free, open source, performance-friendly, and user-focused.

### Different Animation Support for Female and Male Characters

### Detailed and Transparent Logging System
- When a player quits, the following information is automatically logged by the system and can be viewed with a single click:

- Player ID

- Steam ID
